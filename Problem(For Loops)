Problem Statement :

Objective:

In this challenge, you will learn the usage of the for loop, which is a programming language statement which allows code to be executed until a terminal condition is met. They can even repeat forever if the terminal condition is never met.

The syntax for the for loop is:

for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>
 1. expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.
 2. expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
 3. expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.
The following loop initializes i to 0, tests that i is less than 10, and increments i at every iteration. It will execute 10 times.

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}


Task:

For each integer n in the interval [a,b] (given as input) :

 1. If 1<=n<=9, then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for 1, "two" for 2, and so on.
 2. Else if n>9 and it is an even number, then print "even".
 3. Else if n>9 and it is an odd number, then print "odd".


Input Format:

The first line contains an integer, a.
The seond line contains an integer, b.

Constraints:
1<=a<=b<=10^6


Output Format:

Print the appropriate English representation,even, or odd, based on the conditions described in the 'task' section.
